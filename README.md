# VBA-Array-Constant
Simple simulated List (1D) or Table (2D) VBA Constant Array

I've seen lots of different ways to get around VBA's lack of Constant Arrays. But I wanted something that looks, at least somewhat, like a table and doesn't have to be pre-populated like a Scripting.Dictionary or VBA.Collection.

It's very limited (strings only) and terribly ineffcient. Nothing more that a pipe and vbLf delimited Const String with some simple query functions. Might be useful for small, simple, static lookup list or tables.
